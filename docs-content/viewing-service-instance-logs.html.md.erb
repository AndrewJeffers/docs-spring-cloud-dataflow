<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF provides access to the logs generated by each Data Flow server service instance, including logs for each of the two backing applications (Data Flow server application and Skipper application) for each instance. You can view these logs either using the Service Instance Logs cf CLI plugin or by visiting the dashboard of the Spring Cloud Data Flow service broker.

##<a id='using-the-cf-cli-plugin'></a> Using the cf CLI Plugin

After installing the [Service Instance Logs cf CLI plugin](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/service-instance-logs-cli-plugin/) (see the instructions in the [Installing](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/service-instance-logs-cli-plugin/blob/master/README.md#installing) section of the plugin's [README](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/service-instance-logs-cli-plugin/blob/master/README.md)), you can use the `service-logs` command to tail logs or dump recent logs for a service instance.

To tail logs for a Data Flow service instance, run `cf service-logs SERVICE_NAME`, where `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of the service instance:

<%= partial vars.scdf_logs_tail %>

To dump recent logs for the instance, use the `--recent` flag:

<%= partial vars.scdf_logs_recent %>

If your Pivotal Cloud Foundry deployment uses a self-signed certificate, you must use the `--skip-ssl-validation` flag to disable the default validation of the platform's SSL certificate:

<%= partial vars.scdf_logs_skip %>

## <a id="using-the-service-broker-dashboard"></a>Using the Service Broker Dashboard

<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: To access the service broker dashboard, you must be a Space Developer in the broker application's space (this is typically the <code>system</code> org and <code>p-dataflow</code> space).</p>

Visit the Spring Cloud Data Flow service broker's dashboard. You can access it at the following URL, where `apps.example.com` is the application domain of your PCF deployment:
 
```
https://p-dataflow.apps.example.com/
```

The dashboard shows the name, org, and space of each service instance, as well as a link to view logs for the instance.

<%= image_tag(vars.scdf_img_broker_dashboard) %>

Click the **Logs** link to view logs for a particular service instance's backing application.

<%= image_tag(vars.scdf_img_recent_logs) %>

You can stream current logs for the instance by clicking the **&#x25BA;** button.

<%= image_tag(vars.scdf_img_stream_logs) %>

##<a id='reading-aggregated-logs'></a> Reading Aggregated Logs

The logs retrieved by the Service Instance Logs cf CLI plugin aggregate logs from two backing applications: a Spring Cloud Data Flow server application and a Spring Cloud Skipper application. The following excerpt shows logs after deploying a stream:

The Data Flow server application's logs are identified as belonging to the `dataflow` application. The Spring Cloud Skipper application is called `skipper`.
