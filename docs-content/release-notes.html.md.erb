**Release Date:** November 15, 2018

Enhancements included in this release:

* A service instance now can be configured at create or update time to use the Spring Cloud Data Flow OSS concurrent task launch limit, using a new `concurrent-task-limit` parameter.
* A service instance now can be configured at create or update time to support either only tasks (without stream support) or only streams (without task support), using new `task-only` and `stream-only` parameters.
* Binding credentials from bound apps or service keys now can be used to give API access to the Data Flow server and Spring Cloud Skipper backing apps for a service instance.
* The Java version used has been upgraded to resolve a vulnerability present in OpenJDK 1.8u182 and earlier.
