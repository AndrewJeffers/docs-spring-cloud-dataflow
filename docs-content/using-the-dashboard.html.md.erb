<p class='note'><strong>Note</strong>: In order to have read and write access to a Spring Cloud Data Flow for PCF service instance, you must have the <code>SpaceDeveloper</code> role in the space where the service instance was created. If you have only the <code>SpaceAuditor</code> role in the space where the service instance was created, you have only read (not write) access to the service instance.</p>

To find the dashboard, navigate in <%= vars.scs_platform_name %> Apps Manager to the Data Flow service instance's space, click the listing for the service instance, and then click **Manage**.

If you are using version 6.8.0 or later of the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface tool (cf CLI), you can also use `cf service SERVICE_NAME`, where `SERVICE_NAME` is the name of the Data Flow service instance:
